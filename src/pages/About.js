          AirBears at Berkeley is a student-run organization based at the
          University of California, Berkeley dedicated to fostering a community
          of diverse and welcoming individuals by exposing community members to
          the incredible and fear-conquering experience of skydiving in a way
          that is as accessible as possible.Â (Est. 1969)
          <br />
          <br />
          As the premier skydiving club of UC Berkeley, we take pride in
          representing the bold spirit and innovative legacy of our university.
          Our community embodies the Cal's values of excellence, pushing
          boundaries, and pursuing passions beyond the conventional, and
          continue to do so by offering our community members the unique
          opportunity to explore the skydiving world together. Outside of this,
          we also strive to have a close-knit community with frequent socials
          (e.g. climbing days, camping, study nights). Through our services,
          community members are instilled not only with thrilling skydiving
          experiences, but also greater leadership, teamwork, and resilience.
